## The Blog API

You're tasked with extending a simple Blog API (no frontend needed!) in Kotlin with Spring Boot.
The API has some very basic endpoints for creating and fetching all blog posts.
You will add some more endpoints (see below) and possibly add some tests if you see that it's required.

You shouldn't spend more than maximum 4 hours on the task.
If you run out of time - think about what you would've done if you had more time and why you'd do those specific things.

## Conditions of Satisfaction

- There are some tests (if you don't have time, spend some time to think about how you would've tested the solution and why)
- The REST API should be extended to have the following functionality:
  - There should be a limit on the size of the title and body of a blog post.
    A title should not contain more than 50 characters, and may not include the characters: [ ] / \
    The body should not be more than 800 characters long.
  - When adding a blog-post, it should also be possible to send in one or more tags that the post should have. A post can only have one tag with the same name (i.e. sending in tags=("tech", "kotlin", "tech") should result in the saved post having tags=("tech","kotlin").
  - It should be possible to fetch only blog posts that have a certain tag, or multiple tags. If multiple tags are sent in, the API should only return posts that have all of the tags.
  - It should be possible to send in an author name when creating a blog post
  - Another endpoint should be available that can mark a certain author as a "premium user". Being a premium user allows the author to write more blog posts, which is covered in the next step.
  - Due to how this blog platform will be monetized, there is now a restriction that an author can only post 3 posts before having to be a "premium" user. If posting the 4th post, and the author is not a premium user, the API should reject the request. Premium authors have no limits on the number of blog posts they can write.
  - A premium user will have to pay a fee for their use of the platform. The pricing scheme looks like this:
    - Being a premium user costs a membership-fee of 10 EUR per month (joining any day during the month means you pay for the full month). 
    - Posts 1-3 are free of charge.
    - For each blog post after the 3rd until the 10th, it costs 1 EUR per day
    - For each blog post after the 10th, it costs 0.5 EUR per day
    
    Example: 
    Alex became a premium user on the 1st of March. He posted 4 posts on the 2nd of March, and then on the 15th of March wrote more posts to have a total of 15 posts. 
    Alex will for the Month of March pay: 
    
    1x10 EUR membership fee + 
    
    30 days fees รก 1 EUR for his 4th post, 30x1 EUR + 
    
    17 days fees รก 1 EUR for posts 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, 17x6x1 EUR +
    
    17 days fees รก 0.5 EUR for posts 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17x5x0.5 EUR
    
    Total: 184.5 EUR

    There should be an endpoint that takes the name of an author and a month. The endpoint should return the total cost for that author/user for that time period, based on the rules above.

## Things to send in

- Your code, either as a link to a repository or as a zip-file
- A short description of your solution and why you decided to build it like this
- A couple of sentences about how you would handle additional non-functional requirements such as:
  - High load/traffic
  - Authentication & Security
